## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Preserve the branded visitor experience
The generated homepage SHALL preserve the Bold Love Farm & Bakery page title, black-and-gold visual identity, responsive layout, logo, primary shop action, local community statement, and USDA Organic certification information while presenting the current product and local-partner message in a clean, skimmable hierarchy.

The homepage SHALL present “Organic fruits and vegetables, prepared foods, sourdough breads, baked goods, and many other products from our local partners” as its product summary and SHALL NOT present the superseded “Seasonal produce, breads, pastries, and prepared foods grown and made with care, then offered through our online store” sentence.

The supporting story SHALL present these three ideas as distinct paragraphs:

1. “Looking for local food that's fresher, healthier, and better tasting? We can help. Our produce is certified organic and gets to you shortly after coming out of the ground.”
2. “We bake and cook with the same care, so the food reaches you fresh, local, and full of nutrition.”
3. “Love supporting local businesses? So do we! We carry products from 9 other local farms and producers. Shopping with us helps ensure these small, local businesses remain viable and continue providing clean food for our community.”

#### Scenario: View the homepage on a desktop viewport
- **WHEN** a visitor opens the generated root homepage on a desktop-sized viewport
- **THEN** the page presents the title, new product summary, primary shop action, three-part supporting story, logo, and footer in the established black-and-gold design
- **AND** spacing and grouping make the product breadth, freshness message, and support for nine local partners easy to identify while skimming
- **AND** redundant superseded product or partner copy is absent

#### Scenario: View the homepage on a narrow viewport
- **WHEN** a visitor opens the generated root homepage on a narrow mobile viewport
- **THEN** the new product summary and three-part story remain readable and visually distinct without horizontal overflow
- **AND** the primary shop action, logo, and footer information remain visible and usable
